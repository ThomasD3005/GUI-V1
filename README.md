# GUI-V1
A basic GUI with a focus for application registration and login. 
As my first application, although basic and bare bones, is the foundation for future versions I am currently working on. 

I utilized PyQT5 instead of Tkinter. 
Future versions may be made with the PyQT5 designer to create a more dyanimic and appealing GUI.

This basic GUI has massive room for improvement as I further develop my programming skills and expand my knowledge using Python and its packages. 

The ultimate GOAL is to create an appealing and efficient application that can display massive amounts of data in graphical form. It is being created for Data analysis. 

Future Features will include:
- Secure Login & Registration
- MySQL Database Connection
- Interactive Graph
- Ability to compute:
  >Mean  | Standard Deviation | Slope | Linear Regression Models
